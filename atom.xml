Unveiling the Truth"></a>How Secure Is Your Internet Activity When Using Incognito Mode? Unveiling the Truth</h2><p>Privacy and security are two of the most important issues when dealing with any type of technology. It becomes more necessary to prioritize these while browsing the Internet. However, there are several misconceptions that can give a sense of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >false security <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of which is browsing the Internet using Incognito Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/totalav-svg.webp"                      alt="TotalAv Logo" title="totalav-svg"                ></p><p><strong>Stay malware-free with reliable antivirus</strong></p><p>Don’t compromise your Data and Privacy.

Browsers keep a record of your activities including the URLs you visit, search terms that you use, and web pages that you access, among other things. Depending on how it is set up, browsers can also save login information.</p><p>Modern browsers also use cookies to personalize your browsing experience. Each time you visit a website, the browser creates cookies to save personal information to maintain consistency throughout your browsing experience. For example, you only have to log in to social media once even after you close the browser. The authentication information is saved in the cookies which are accessed by the browser to log you in automatically whenever you visit the website.</p><p>Moreover, browsers allow social engines to record the sites that you visit. Ad engines also run on your browser to record your browsing behavior and use it to personalize ad campaigns. Browsers also allow your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to track the pages that you visit.</p><p>With the amount of information that the browser collects, anyone with access to your computer, illegal or otherwise, can take advantage of the files containing your personal information. This opens you to different risks such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >identity theft <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, financial fraud, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Incognito-Mode-Can-Do"><a href="#What-Incognito-Mode-Can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Incognito Mode Can Do?"></a>What Incognito Mode Can Do?</h2><p>Many users assume that surfing the Internet in Incognito Mode protects their privacy and security. While Incognito Mode can do a lot, it can only do so much.</p><p>When you are in private browsing, the browser disables history monitoring. That means the browser will not record any browsing activity. Moreover, cookies created during Incognito Mode are deleted as soon as the private window is closed. Additionally, some extensions and plugins are disabled depending on their settings. The browser still has access to personal information that was gathered during regular browsing.</p><h2 id="What-Incognito-Mode-Cannot-Do"><a href="#What-Incognito-Mode-Cannot-Do" class="headerlink" title="What Incognito Mode Cannot Do?"></a>What Incognito Mode Cannot Do?</h2><p>Your browser is not the only one that’s collecting information about you while you browse. Every single website collects personal data and browsing behavior every time you visit them. As mentioned, ad engines and site engines also record anything that you do. Their goal is to collect information to create personal experiences including ads. Several popular websites and web applications such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Starbucks, Snapchat, and Google <a class="link"   href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidgorodyansky/2013/01/28/guilty-as-charged-facebook-google-snapchat-and-starbucks-caught-for-privacy-violations/#1592bbb030ff" >were caught illegally collecting personal information <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from users who were unaware.</p><p>Private browsing cannot control any third-party entities from monitoring your browsing activities. Moreover, Incognito Mode, on its own, is practically powerless against threats, such as malware, aiming to collect as much information from you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Protect-Your-Privacy"><a href="#How-to-Protect-Your-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="How to Protect Your Privacy?"></a>How to Protect Your Privacy?</h2><p>There are several measures that you can take to protect both your security and privacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Set-up-Browser-Security"><a href="#Set-up-Browser-Security" class="headerlink" title="Set-up Browser Security"></a>Set-up Browser Security</h3><p>Making the browser more secure is the first step in protecting your privacy. You can easily <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >block third-party cookies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your browser. That means it will limit the amount of information it gathers from you. Not being signed in automatically is a small inconvenience for your privacy as the browser will not have your login information.</p><p>Moreover, ensure that you are only using a secure wireless connection. Avoid using public Wi-Fi if possible. You should employ a strong password on your home Wi-Fi connection. Maintaining a secure network not only protects your browser privacy and security but all of the devices on your network as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Ultimate Guide to Public WiFi Security <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975658">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975658">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975658%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975658/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Maintain-Real-Time-Security"><a href="#Maintain-Real-Time-Security" class="headerlink" title="Maintain Real-Time Security"></a>Maintain Real-Time Security</h3><p>Security and privacy concerns should be more than your browser. Many of your applications connect to the Internet without your awareness. There are simple, yet effective steps to take to ensure security and privacy.</p><p>Passwords are the first line of your online presence. Experts suggest using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create complex passwords. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Secure password managers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are also available so you do not have to remember all your passwords. Additionally, most modern password managers can even general strong passwords for each of your online accounts. Strong passwords can protect your privacy by securing your online accounts from the reach of malicious entities.</p><p>It is also important to enable two-factor authentication anywhere you can. For example, you can follow this guide to add this layer of protection to your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Facebook profile <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/" >Google <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> also offers an easy way to turn on the two-factor authentication on all of the Google products that you use.</p><p>More importantly, you need to install a robust anti-malware application such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >MalwareFox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to protect you from various threats. Services like MalwareFox offer real-time solutions such as anti-spyware, anti-adware, and ransomware protection.</p><h3 id="Subscribe-to-VPN-Services"><a href="#Subscribe-to-VPN-Services" class="headerlink" title="Subscribe to VPN Services"></a>Subscribe to VPN Services</h3><p>In today’s well-connected world, it is impossible to guarantee 100% privacy and security. However, subscribing to Virtual Private Network (VPN) services will significantly increase the chances of protecting your network. VPN services employ several layers of protection. First, the VPN client on your computer encrypts your data before it even reaches your ISP.</p><p>Then, the data goes through the VPN server for another layer of protection. At this point, the VPN hides your IP address making the connection anonymous. That means, any third-party technologies, such as ad engines, cannot trace your connection. Moreover, the websites that you visit will not have a record of your personal information.</p><p>There are numerous VPN services out there with different features and price points. However, it is important to note that free VPNs need close observation and review if you are thinking of using one. Popular paid VPN services are often more transparent than the free options.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Security and privacy are modern-day concerns that should be taken seriously. It is imperative that you prioritize your safety as there are dire consequences when ignored. The measures above will improve security and privacy when implemented properly.</p><h3 id="Leave-a-Comment-Cancel-reply"><a href="#Leave-a-Comment-Cancel-reply" class="headerlink" title="Leave a Comment Cancel reply"></a>Leave a Comment <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Cancel reply <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Comment</p><p>Name Email </p><p>Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p><p>Δ</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-mastering-iphone-video-playback-cycles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering iPhone Video Playback Cycles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-optimizing-class-engagement-with-visual-media-usage-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Optimizing Class Engagement with Visual Media Usage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/adapting-to-a-hybrid-future-microsoft-launches-innovative-productivity-gadgets/"><u>Adapting to a Hybrid Future: Microsoft Launches Innovative Productivity Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/disabled-apple-iphone-12-how-to-unlock-a-disabled-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Disabled Apple iPhone 12 How to Unlock a Disabled Apple iPhone 12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-microsofts-answer-to-apple-a-comprehensive-review-of-the-new-surface-pro/"><u>Expert Analysis: Microsoft's Answer to Apple - A Comprehensive Review of the New Surface Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-leveraging-speech-recognition-in-windows-11-featured-on-zdnet/"><u>Expert Tips for Leveraging Speech Recognition in Windows 11 | Featured on ZDNET</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/grab-microsoft-office-at-no-cost-today-with-these-expert-strategies-by-zdnet/"><u>Grab Microsoft Office at No Cost Today with These Expert Strategies by ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/harmonic-windows-tunes-hub/"><u>Harmonic Windows Tunes Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/revive-your-aging-pc-with-these-cost-free-tricks-before-upgrading-to-windows-10-zdnet/"><u>Revive Your Aging PC with These Cost-Free Tricks Before Upgrading to Windows 10 - ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-manuals.techidaily.com/securing-your-data-step-by-step-guide-to-safe-mountpoint-setup-with-amazon-s3/"><u>Securing Your Data: Step-by-Step Guide to Safe Mountpoint Setup with Amazon S3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/simplifying-the-complexity-how-microsofts-flawed-ai-was-cracked-with-minimal-skill-discovered-by-zdnet/"><u>Simplifying the Complexity: How Microsoft’s Flawed AI Was Cracked with Minimal Skill | Discovered by ZDNET</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/step-by-step-into-ai-navigate-with-help-from-our-9-communities/"><u>Step by Step Into AI: Navigate with Help From Our 9 Communities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-the-vanishing-cursor-issue-in-windows-11/"><u>Troubleshooting the Vanishing Cursor Issue in Windows 11</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It is especially a significant issue among kids and teens. The progress in technology did not stop the problem of bullying. It evolves along with growth in technology. Social media becomes the new platform for both connecting with friends and bullying. Cyberbullying is harder than ever to control. The power of anonymity makes it difficult to monitor and stop cyberbullying attacks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/totalav-svg.webp"                      alt="TotalAv Logo" title="totalav-svg"                ></p><p><strong>Stay malware-free with reliable antivirus</strong></p><p>Don’t compromise your Data and Privacy.

Social media, emails, and even websites can serve as platforms for cyberbullying. Moreover, bullies take advantage of the victims’ vulnerability. It may include perceived flaws or intimate information.</p><p>McAfee’s 2014 survey shows that nearly <a class="link"   href="https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2014/q2/20140603-01.aspx" >87% of kids and teens witnessed an act of cyberbullying <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Sadly, 24% of youth report that they do not know what to do in the event of being harassed or bullied online.</p><p>Classic causes of bullying still exist such as appearance, race, religion, and sexuality. However, other reasons arise in research about cyberbullying. The McAfee study reports that 50% of respondents were involved in an argument because of something they posted online. The tendency of the youth to overshare makes them very vulnerable.</p><p>Only 61% of youth have their privacy protection enabled in their social media accounts. Moreover, 52% do not turn off their location services on mobile devices. Fourteen percent even post their home addresses online. Children are also less likely to have their parents within their online circle of connections.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Windows 10 Privacy Issues and Fix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Types-of-Cyberbullying"><a href="#Types-of-Cyberbullying" class="headerlink" title="Types of Cyberbullying"></a>Types of Cyberbullying</h2><p>There are countless types of cyberbullying. Children receive threats online all the time.</p><h3 id="Online-Bashing"><a href="#Online-Bashing" class="headerlink" title="Online Bashing"></a>Online Bashing</h3><p>One of the most common forms of cyberbullying is bashing. It often happens in message boards, posts, threads, and messaging apps. Teens often use these platforms to chat and discuss their school lives.</p><p>Conversations and discussions can turn ugly fast. Offline harassment can spill over online. A group of bullies may target a vulnerable victim.</p><h3 id="Gossiping"><a href="#Gossiping" class="headerlink" title="Gossiping"></a>Gossiping</h3><p>The rapid exchange of information online can quickly lead to gossiping.

Free download the best Catchvideo alternative to download any video or audio from 10000+ website on Mac and Windows.</p><p>In this article you will learn the limitations of Catchvideo and also know the best Catchvideo Alternative.</p><p>Catchvideo is a good website to download online videos to MP4, WebM, MP3, FLAC, etc. You just need to paste the video link and click ‘Catch!’ button. But Catchvideo has its own limitations and some users expect to try some Catchvideo alternatives, see the following ones I collected from Google Forum:</p><p><em>I often use Catchvideo to download YouTube videos, but a few days ago I found that it failed to download some YouTube videos. And now I really need a Catchvideo alternative to help me to download YouTube videos. Can anyone help me by recommending a workable Catchvideo alternative?</em> <em>I like to use Catchvideo to download videos from YouTube, Dailymotion, etc. And now I need to download some videos from some online learning website, including Udemy, Lynda, etc., but it seems that Catchvideo can not help me to download videos from these online learning websites. Is there a Catchvideo alternative which can help me to download videos from these above online learning websites?</em></p><p><strong>Limitations of Catchvideo</strong></p><ul><li>The supported video websites are limited and only include the popular ones, like YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Viki, Twitter, Metacafe, Break, Youku, Facebook, etc. The news websites, like BBC, New York Times, CNN, etc and the online learning websites, like Lynda, Udemy, etc and the websites in other type are not supported.</li><li>The downloaded video output formats and audio output formats are limited. The output formats include MP4, WebM, 3GP, FLV and the output audio formats include MP3, OGG, AAC, FLAC.</li><li>Catchvideo can not download some videos from the supported websites, such as some YouTube copyrighted videos.</li><li>Catchvideo can not batch download multiple videos at one time. You can only download video individually.</li><li>The downloading speed is not that fast and you need to be patient to wait for a few minutes to complete the video downloading.</li></ul><h3 id="Why-Need-Allavsoft"><a href="#Why-Need-Allavsoft" class="headerlink" title="Why Need Allavsoft?"></a>Why Need Allavsoft?</h3><p>M3U8 is actually a playlist and one of M3U files which is encoded in UTF-8 characters. M3U8 is originally developed for audios but later some media players and programs like Winamp, KMPlayer, iTunes, VLC media player etc can also support to open M3U8 files. However, commonly used downloaders are not easy to download M3U8 files. If you want to download M3U8 files to your mobile devices, laptops or hard disks for viewing or editing, you need a functional M3U8 downloader, like Allavsoft.</p><h3 id="The-Best-Catchvideo-Alternative-Allavsoft"><a href="#The-Best-Catchvideo-Alternative-Allavsoft" class="headerlink" title="The Best Catchvideo Alternative - Allavsoft"></a>The Best Catchvideo Alternative - Allavsoft</h3><p>To avoid all these above Catchvideo limitations you may want to try a Catchvideo alternative. Allavsoft just stands itself out as the best Catchvideo alternative. The key features of Allavsoft is listed as follows:</p><ul><li>Download videos from over 10,000 video and audio websites, including the video sharing websites, like YouTube, Facebook, etc and the news websites, like CNN, BBC, New York Times, etc and online learning websites, like SitePoint, Lynda, etc and other types of video websites.</li><li>Download all these videos or audios to MP4, AVI, FLV, MOV, MKV, ASF, AVCHD, MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, M4A, WMA, OGG, AIFF and any other video or audio format.</li><li>Support to batch download multiple videos or audios at one time.</li><li>The downloaded output quality is as good as the original one, if not better.</li><li>Download videos or audios from all supported video or audio website, and all you need to provide is the video or audio URL.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Use-Catchvideo-Alternative-Allavsoft"><a href="#How-to-Use-Catchvideo-Alternative-Allavsoft" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Catchvideo Alternative - Allavsoft?"></a>How to Use Catchvideo Alternative - Allavsoft?</h3><p>The following guide will take downloading video from Viki as the example and the guide can also be used to download video or audio from any other video or audio website.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398449/3022" target="_top" id="398449">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398449" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398449/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Make-Preparation-Free-download-Catchvideo-Alternative"><a href="#Make-Preparation-Free-download-Catchvideo-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Make Preparation: Free download Catchvideo Alternative"></a>Make Preparation: Free download Catchvideo Alternative</h3><p>Free download the best alternative to Catchvideo - Allavsoft (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/allavsoft/products/" >for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/allavsoft/products/" >for Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) , install and then launch it, the following interface will pop up.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/allavsoft/products/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.allavsoft.com/images/how-to/free-download-win.jpg"                                     ></a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/allavsoft/products/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.allavsoft.com/images/how-to/free-download-mac.jpg"                                     ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.allavsoft.com/images/allavsoft/screen-shot-600.jpg"                      alt="The best Catchvideo Alternative - Allavsoft"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Enter-Viki-URL"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-Viki-URL" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Enter Viki URL"></a>Step 1 Enter Viki URL</h3><p>Go to Viki website.

Then you could find yourself on the outs with Microsoft. </p><p>Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 are no longer supported by the folks in Redmond. This means that anyone still running these versions won’t receive future bug fixes, security patches, or other updates. And that could place your computer at a greater risk for malware, security flaws, and other threats.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/" >Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On Sunday, Microsoft revised its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information" >Windows 11 release information page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to indicate the retirement of the two older versions, listing both 21H2 and 22H2 as having reached the end of servicing for Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. Only the Enterprise and Education editions are spared; they’re still able to receive updates to Windows 11 22H2 until October 14 of 2025.</p><p>How do you know which version you’re running? That’s easy enough. Head to Settings, select System, and then click About. Scroll down to the section for Windows specifications to find the version. If Windows 11 23H2 is listed, then you’re fine. But what if you’re stuck with an older edition? In that case, you can update your PC yourself, or Microsoft will now do it for you.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-going-to-start-charging-for-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-how-much/" >Microsoft is going to start charging for Windows 10 updates next year. Here’s how much <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Go to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button for “Check for Updates.” Microsoft will download and install the latest updates, which will include 23H2. If you don’t do this yourself and automatic updates are turned on, the update will automatically run as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday, rolled out on September 10.</p><p>Keeping track of Windows updates can be challenging and frustrating, especially with so many of them pushed out on a regular and irregular basis. Microsoft has tried to streamline the major updates by launching them annually and naming them with the year and period. But the names can be confusing since we’re almost in the final quarter of 2024 and Windows 11 is still stuck on a 2023 version. In the midst of this messiness, making sure your PC is fully protected against security hazards is the most critical task.</p><p>On its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center" >Windows Message Center page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Microsoft issued this warning:</p><p>**”**The October 2024 security update is the last security release for Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 21H2 and Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, version 22H2. After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In the following message, Microsoft explains that it will perform the update if you fail to do so:</p><p>“To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 11 Home and Pro devices that are not managed by IT departments when these are nearing end of servicing. Moving to Windows 11, version 23H2 keeps your device supported and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How long will it be before Windows 11 23H2 is no longer supported? That depends on when 24H2 is released to the general public. Right now, this year’s major Windows 11 update is officially available only on <a class="link"   href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5043950-windows-11-version-24h2-support-2fd719b6-8c26-469f-99fe-832eb1b702d7" >Copilot PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/" >through Release Preview builds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s assume that 24H2 kicks off to everyone by the end of 2024. Then the current flavor of 23H2 should have at least another year of life left before Microsoft forces you to update again.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/"  title="6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what&#39;s coming later)">6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what’s coming later) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-your-windows-license-legal-should-you-even-care/"  title="Is your Windows license legal?

It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/" >restore your computer to previous functional status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.</p><p>In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is <strong>no longer available for the Home user</strong>. It was <strong>discontinued by Symantec in 2013</strong>. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993651">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993651">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993651.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993651%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993651/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step"></a>How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step</h2><p>Here in this guide, you will get the detailed steps about how to use Symantec Ghost in Windows 11&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;7.

It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/" >restore your computer to previous functional status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.</p><p>In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is <strong>no longer available for the Home user</strong>. It was <strong>discontinued by Symantec in 2013</strong>. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step"></a>How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step</h2><p>Here in this guide, you will get the detailed steps about how to use Symantec Ghost in Windows 11&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;7. You can simply search “<strong>Norton Ghost 15 download</strong>” via your browser to get the tool. As we have mentioned above, it only offers a 30-day free trial.

></p><p>OnlineVideoConverter 是一款多功能的線上檔案轉換工具，其中包括將 YouTube 檔案轉換成 WAV 格式的功能，也支援用 YouTube 影片連結直接轉檔。而且不只 WAV 檔案，MP3、WMA、MP4、WMV、MOV 等最常用的音訊及影片檔也都一併支援，可以滿足一般轉檔需求。</p><p><strong>優點：</strong></p><ul><li><strong>支援多種轉檔方式：</strong>OnlineVideoConverter 可以轉換檔案，也可以直接用影片轉檔。只要把 YouTube 影片的原始連結貼在頁面裡，就可以直接開始轉換檔案格式，不需要額外使用 YouTube 影片下載器。除了 YouTube 之外，也支援 Facebook、Instagram、Vimeo 等十多個流行的影片網站。</li><li><strong>支援不同音質：</strong>OnlineVideoConverter 支援從 320 kbps 到 64 kpbs 的不同音質檔案，可以依需求選擇。320 kbps 的檔案足以作為影片配樂使用，適合想用 YouTube 音檔再創作的使用者。</li><li><strong>可直接選擇想轉檔的影片長度：</strong>在 OnlineVideoConverter 的網站裡貼上影片連結後，就可以直接在同頁面上選擇想轉換成 WAV 檔案的影片長度，非常方便，也可以節省轉換較長影片的時間。</li><li><strong>支援繁體中文：</strong>OnlineVideoConverter 支援 15 種語言，其中包括繁體中文，英文不好也可以輕鬆使用。</li></ul><p><strong>缺點：</strong></p><ul><li><strong>廣告太多：</strong>開始轉檔之後，頁面上會跳出不少廣告。免費轉換工具有廣告十分常見，但 OnlineVideoConverter 對於廣告的篩選機制似乎不佳，不少網友都反應曾看過詐騙廣告，且快顯視窗頻繁出現，使用時要格外小心並保持耐性。</li><li><strong>客服支援不足：</strong>線上軟體總難免會碰到服務失靈的情況，如果真的不幸遇到了，OnlineVideoConverter 的技術支援似乎有待加強。許多網友都反應，曾嘗試聯絡客服多次，卻遲遲無法取得回應。</li></ul><!-- affiliate

再適合不過。點擊兩下，就能取得想要的檔案格式。</li><li><strong>轉檔速度快：</strong>YouTubeTo.org 的檔案處理速度很快，3 分鐘的 YouTube 影片檔案，不到 1 分鐘就能轉成 WAV 檔提供下載，效率很高。</li><li><strong>沒有廣告干擾：</strong>YouTubeTo.org 是由非盈利團隊建立的網站，因此沒有廣告干擾，不用擔心點到詐騙廣告。</li><li><strong>支援繁體中文：</strong>YouTubeTo.org 支援 20 多種語言，繁體中文也包括在內。</li></ul><p><strong>缺點：</strong></p><ul><li><strong>無法選擇音質：</strong>YouTubeTo.org

下載器和轉換工具：</strong>安裝軟體之後，下載 YouTube 影片和檔案轉換在同一個介面上就可以完成。此外，這款軟體還提供了透過瀏覽器一鍵下載的功能，輕輕鬆鬆就可以把 YouTube 影片以影片或 MP3 的格式存到電腦上。</li><li><strong>支援不同音質檔案輸出：</strong>免費的 ByClickDownloader 支援不同音質選擇，使用者可以根據需求直接選擇「最佳」或「一般」，也可以自訂音質。適合對檔案音質有特殊需求的使用者。</li><li><strong>可同時轉換多個檔案：</strong>支援同時轉換多個檔案，非常適合有大量 YouTube 影片轉檔需求的使用者。</li><li><strong>不需擔心 WAV

很像，是結合了下載器和轉換工具的軟體，需要下載到電腦上才能使用。這款軟體不只支援 YouTube 影片下載，也能下載大量 Facebook、Instagram、Dailymotion、TikTok 等熱門影音網站的影片。此外，iTubeGo 還有下載字幕和擷取片段的功能。值得注意的是，iTubeGo 的免費版本只能轉換三分之一的檔案長度，且不支援 WAV 格式，如果想要轉換完整的 WAV 檔案，需購買提供 30 天免費試用的付費版本。</p><p><strong>優點：</strong></p><ul><li><strong>融合 YouTube 下載器和轉換工具：</strong>付費版的 iTubeGo 可說是功能最強大的線上影片下載器和轉檔工具，不只支援同時下載高畫質影片，可用的影音檔案格式也非常完整，適合需要處理大量線上影片的專業人士使用。</li><li><strong>能轉換影片片段：</strong>iTubeGo 內建影片裁剪功能，可以根據需求轉換片段，省時又方便。</li><li><strong>轉檔音質極高：</strong>iTubeGo

功能非常有限，只支援 MP4 和 MP3 格式，而且無法轉換完整檔案。想體驗這款強大軟體的使用者可以先從 30 天試用開始。</li><li><strong>需要安裝軟體：</strong>iTubeGo 不提供線上服務，不適合想快速轉檔的使用者<strong>。</strong></li></ul><p>以上 6 款軟體都相當實用，各有各自的優點和缺點。總結來說，如果需要快速轉換 1-2 個小型 YouTube 檔案，推薦使用可直接在線上透過連結來轉檔的 YouTubeTo.org 和 YTConverter.app；如果想轉換特定片段，那麼 OnlineVideoConverter 就是不二之選。對於透過線上工具下載檔案有安全顧慮的使用者，則可以用 Media.io，直接把轉換好的 WAV 檔案存到雲端。</p><p>至於 ByClickDownloader 和 iTubeGo 兩款工具是需要下載的桌面軟體，除了支援檔案轉換之外，還結合了下載器、影片編輯、同時下載多個檔案的功能，適合需要大量處理 YouTube 影片檔案的使用者。其中 ByClickDownloader 的免費版本功能較完整，iTubeGo 則必須要付費才能轉換完整檔案。</p><p>Movavi Video Converter</p><p>理想的辦法是讓你的媒體成為你需要的格式！</p><p><a
