## How did I get infected?

Gosearches.gg is a kind of malware that could infect your system without your information or consent. There are several ways that Gosearches.gg can get into your systems.

One way is through software program downloading. Hackers frequently bundle their malware with legitimate software downloads, so it will also get into your system while installing it. That is why it’s important to update and download software programs from legitimate resources and constantly examine the setup instructions cautiously.

Another way that Gosearches.gg can get into your device through phishing emails. Malicious actors or hackers often send out updated emails that look like they are coming from legitimate organisations, asking you to update, download an attachment or click on a link. If you click on any link, the malware gets set up on your system.

Gosearches.gg also can infect your machine through social engineering procedures. These notifications are coming from legitimate websites or pop-up commercials. If you click on them, the malware gets into your device.
