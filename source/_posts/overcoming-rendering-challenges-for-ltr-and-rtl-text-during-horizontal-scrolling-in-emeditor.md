Hi Yutaka,  
EmEditor is very good at displaying TSV texts. I have lots of these files and many of them have very long lines that leave large parts of the line off-screen. When I scroll horizontally to reveal these off-screen text, the display is badly rendered and garbled. Clicking anywhere in the window causes EE to re-render the display correctly. This is rather annoying.  
Yutaka, please read on. I am not suggesting to make EE a BiDi editor, (although this would make me rather happy :-)). I suspect that this is a small rendering problem but still…!  
I will send you screen shots of both the garbled display and how it should look. I will also send you a file that demonstrate the problem.  
Regards  
 Meir

Hello Meir,  
You can write a macro (it can be a dummy macro, for example just one comment line)  
`//`  
and then associate to the “Scrolled” event. (Macros menu > Customize > select the macro name you created, click “Runs at Events”, click “Events…” button, and check “Scrolled”, and select Delay Time 0.  
When a macro is finished running, EmEditor automatically redraws the whole window.  
Thanks!

Thanks Yutaka!  
Works like a charm! Proves, as though a proff was required, how little I know this tool that I use for six-plus years… I repeat my “Tip-of-the-Day” suggestion.
