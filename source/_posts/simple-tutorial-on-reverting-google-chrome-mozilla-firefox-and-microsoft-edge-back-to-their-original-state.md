## Why do you need to Reset the Browser?

Apart from being able to provide various features on its own; there are also some additional programs available that improve the browsing experience further. These programs are called extensions or add-ons; which renders extra powers and features to the browsers’ interface to every page it loads. However, difficulties do happen with these browsers, no matter how well they are programmed.

The issues comprise frequent crash; unnecessary ad pop-ups; unwanted re-directions; security threats; etc. It eventually, they slow down the system’s performance, and hence it needs to be cleared forthwith. The default and accessible way to solve these kinds of problems is to reset the browser to default settings.

It is quite an easy endeavor; however, the default state will almost erase everything.

### Mozilla FireFox

* Select the **Open Help Menu** (Question mark symbol) option, from the _Firefox menu_.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/3-5.png)

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

* Now from the slide-out, select the **“Troubleshooting Information”** option**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* In the oncoming grey color page, look for the **“Refresh Firefox.” You can find it** in the upper-right corner of the window, under the _Give Firefox a tune-up_, section. Hit the mouse on it.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-3.png)

* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

Now, you have successfully reset the Firefox to its default state. The refresh feature will create a new profile for the users. Firefox will store all of the critical data on the desktop in a new folder, named as “**Old Firefox Data**.”

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.

## Keep your Browsing Experience Safe

In any case, it is essential to protect your PC from all kinds of malware attack. The only potentially practical solution for this is, installing a good anti-malware software. You might already have an antivirus enabled on your computer.

Antivirus programs aren’t capable of identifying many kinds of new and emerging malware. Therefore, an anti-malware is the only solution for getting over the malware and spyware correctly. On that note, it is highly recommended to use MalwareFox, an efficient anti-malware that significantly helps in removing the various types of malware from your system. It delivers better results when compared to the process of resetting the browser to default settings.
