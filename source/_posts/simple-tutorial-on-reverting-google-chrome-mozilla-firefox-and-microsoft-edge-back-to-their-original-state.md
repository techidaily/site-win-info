* Just, click “**Reset**” to confirm the process of default chrome settings.

Thus successfully, your chrome has changed to the default stage without losing your important files or saved information.

### Mozilla FireFox

Open the **Firefox** menu button, located on the upper-right corner of the browser window.

* Select the **Open Help Menu** (Question mark symbol) option, from the _Firefox menu_.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/3-5.png)

* Now from the slide-out, select the **“Troubleshooting Information”** option**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* Now from the slide-out, select the **“Troubleshooting Information”** option**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* In the oncoming grey color page, look for the **“Refresh Firefox.” You can find it** in the upper-right corner of the window, under the _Give Firefox a tune-up_, section. Hit the mouse on it.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-3.png)

* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

Now, you have successfully reset the Firefox to its default state. The refresh feature will create a new profile for the users. Firefox will store all of the critical data on the desktop in a new folder, named as “**Old Firefox Data**.”

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.

## Keep your Browsing Experience Safe

On that note, it is highly recommended to use MalwareFox, an efficient anti-malware that significantly helps in removing the various types of malware from your system.
