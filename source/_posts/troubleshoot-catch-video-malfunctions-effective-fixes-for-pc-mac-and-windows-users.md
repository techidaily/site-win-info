Catchvideo is a good website to download online videos to MP4, WebM, MP3, FLAC, etc. You just need to paste the video link and click 'Catch!' button. But Catchvideo has its own limitations and some users expect to try some Catchvideo alternatives, see the following ones I collected from Google Forum:

_I often use Catchvideo to download YouTube videos, but a few days ago I found that it failed to download some YouTube videos. And now I really need a Catchvideo alternative to help me to download YouTube videos. Can anyone help me by recommending a workable Catchvideo alternative?_ _I like to use Catchvideo to download videos from YouTube, Dailymotion, etc. And now I need to download some videos from some online learning website, including Udemy, Lynda, etc., but it seems that Catchvideo can not help me to download videos from these online learning websites. Is there a Catchvideo alternative which can help me to download videos from these above online learning websites?_

**Limitations of Catchvideo**

* The supported video websites are limited and only include the popular ones, like YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Viki, Twitter, Metacafe, Break, Youku, Facebook, etc. The news websites, like BBC, New York Times, CNN, etc and the online learning websites, like Lynda, Udemy, etc and the websites in other type are not supported.
* The downloaded video output formats and audio output formats are limited. The output formats include MP4, WebM, 3GP, FLV and the output audio formats include MP3, OGG, AAC, FLAC.

### Why Need Allavsoft?

M3U8 is actually a playlist and one of M3U files which is encoded in UTF-8 characters. M3U8 is originally developed for audios but later some media players and programs like Winamp, KMPlayer, iTunes, VLC media player etc can also support to open M3U8 files. However, commonly used downloaders are not easy to download M3U8 files. If you want to download M3U8 files to your mobile devices, laptops or hard disks for viewing or editing, you need a functional M3U8 downloader, like Allavsoft.
