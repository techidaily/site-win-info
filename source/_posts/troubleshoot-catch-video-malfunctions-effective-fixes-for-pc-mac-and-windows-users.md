M3U8 is actually a playlist and one of M3U files which is encoded in UTF-8 characters. M3U8 is originally developed for audios but later some media players and programs like Winamp, KMPlayer, iTunes, VLC media player etc can also support to open M3U8 files. However, commonly used downloaders are not easy to download M3U8 files. If you want to download M3U8 files to your mobile devices, laptops or hard disks for viewing or editing, you need a functional M3U8 downloader, like Allavsoft.
