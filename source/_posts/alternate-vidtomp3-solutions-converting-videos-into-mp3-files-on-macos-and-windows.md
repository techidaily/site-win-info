## Alternate VidToMP3 Solutions: Converting Videos Into MP3 Files on macOS & Windows

### Overview

VidToMP3 is a good website to download YouTube videos, Vimeo videos, Myspace videos and videos from other famous video websites to MP3 and VidToMP3 can serve most of users who do not have special needs. But recently we are getting more and more complaints about VidToMP3, see the followings:

* I can not download Vevo videos to MP3, why? Can't VidToMP3 support Vevo? If so, I will be very upset.
* When I download some videos from YouTube, I failed but get the message "Grabbing Failed". Why? Did I miss some updates?
* When using VidToMP3 to download videos sometimes I get the error message "Invalid URL" but the video can be watched online without any problem. Why?
* I want to use VidToMP3 to download some videos to WAV. Can I set VidToMP3 to download the video to WAV?

### VidToMP3 is a good free website but it has some downsides as follows:

* VidToMP3 only supports a part of video websites and there are many video websites that VidToMP3 can not support, Vevo is one of them and so also are some copyrighted video websites.
* If a video from some supported video website is blocked or restricted by country VidToMP3 still can not download it. And you may get the error message "Grabbing Failed" or "Invalid URL".
* For now VidToMP3 can only download video to MP3 audio format. WAV, AAC, AIFF, FLAC and other audio formats are not available by VidToMP3\. **So is there some VidToMP3 Alternative which can avoid all VidToMP3 downsides? The answer is positive.
