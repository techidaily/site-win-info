## What is Cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is a type of harassment that happens through electronic means. Social media, emails, and even websites can serve as platforms for cyberbullying. Moreover, bullies take advantage of the victims’ vulnerability. It may include perceived flaws or intimate information.

McAfee’s 2014 survey shows that nearly [87% of kids and teens witnessed an act of cyberbullying](https://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2014/q2/20140603-01.aspx). Sadly, 24% of youth report that they do not know what to do in the event of being harassed or bullied online.

Classic causes of bullying still exist such as appearance, race, religion, and sexuality. However, other reasons arise in research about cyberbullying. The McAfee study reports that 50% of respondents were involved in an argument because of something they posted online. The tendency of the youth to overshare makes them very vulnerable.

Only 61% of youth have their privacy protection enabled in their social media accounts. Moreover, 52% do not turn off their location services on mobile devices. Fourteen percent even post their home addresses online. Children are also less likely to have their parents within their online circle of connections.

### Online Bashing

One of the most common forms of cyberbullying is bashing. It often happens in message boards, posts, threads, and messaging apps. Teens often use these platforms to chat and discuss their school lives.

Conversations and discussions can turn ugly fast. Offline harassment can spill over online. A group of bullies may target a vulnerable victim.

### Gossiping

The rapid exchange of information online can quickly lead to gossiping. False information can pass from one person to another. Bullies may use perceived flaws to humiliate the victim further. They may even create pages or groups to spread gossip also. It isolates the victim from his or her peers. Isolation can rapidly cause depression and anxiety.

### Exposure

Kids and teens also reveal a bit too much online. They pass personal and intimate information without much thought about privacy. Bullies will then use this to threaten the victim. Photos or videos which may be damaging to the victim’s reputation can spread. It may even affect the victim’s future such as academic opportunities and job potential.
