## What is Summon to Court for Pedophilia Email?

“Summon to Court for Pedophilia” refers to fake government emails that look like court summonses. These emails say that the person receiving them is being accused of paedophilia. 

This spam mail can look pretty professional, with emblems, seals, and other images that are usually associated with government institutions. Also, the names of real people in positions like Director General of Police, Commissioner of Police, etc. may be used in the letters. In one of the sample email, the [name of a real Chief Law officer of Malta](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/new-email-scam-threatens-recipients-paedophilia-court-charges.979598), Cutajar was used. 

It requests that recipients submit their explanations by email within 72 hours so that it can be reviewed and validated.

The “Summon To Court For Pedophilia” emails are a scam. In addition, the [French Ministry of the Interior](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/actualites/communiques/escroquerie-au-faux-courriel) has issued warnings against believing these emails.

## How does Summon to Court for Pedophilia Email Scam Work?

We looked at three different versions of the “Summon to Court for Pedophilia” emails and came up with the following conclusions.

From all the legalese, the most important thing to know is that the person receiving the letter is accused of pedophilia, sex trafficking, child pornography, cyber pornography, exhibitionism, etc. 

As I said in the beginning, the “Summon to Court for Pedophilia” emails are not real. So, everything they say is false, and the people who got the summons have not been accused of doing anything wrong.

The first goal of this email is to get the people who get it to start talking to the scammers. Once contact is made, the cybercriminals may demand that the recipients give them private information (such as personally identifiable details, ID card data, passport scans, banking account log-in credentials, credit card numbers, etc.), pay “fines” (transfer money to the scammers under false pretences), or do other things.

This is similar to [GeekSquad Email Scam](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or [Apple ID Phishing scam](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) which creates fictional situation to make their victim pay money to cyber criminals.
